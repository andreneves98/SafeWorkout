# SafeWorkout

### [G10] - André Neves 84948, Dany Costa 85097

Mobile application developed in Flutter within the scope of Mobile Computing course.

## Application Context:
With the pandemic we are living in, there are a lot of people that became sedentary or are losing their motivation to work out.  Gyms are still a place that most are afraid to attend because it is a common place where people tend to gather. For that reason, working out at home or outside becomes a reasonable solution and probably healthier. 

## Application Purpose:

The goal of SafeWorkout is to motivate the users to workout at home or outside, without the need of gym equipment. Our app will have a section dedicated to social interaction where users can see the evolution and training plans of their friends. This will bring not only motivation but also some kind of competition. Moreover, we intend to improve the users’ health.
